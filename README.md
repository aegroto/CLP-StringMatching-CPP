This repository contains a C++ implementation of the original Skip Search algorithms (Naive, KMP and Alpha) plus a really simple Morris-Pratt algorithm implementation for comparing and debugging during the coding phase.

We propose two alternative implementations of Alpha Skip Search, whom reinterpret the trie data structure between the original algorithm, named Beta and Gamma. The latter registered really nice results during testing and may be the best choice for pratical applications.

Experimental utils, results and sources are included.

Everything you may find here has been developed as a univerisity project for an Algorithm Lab course, held by Prof. Faro (http://www.dmi.unict.it/~faro/laboratorio_algoritmi.php).
